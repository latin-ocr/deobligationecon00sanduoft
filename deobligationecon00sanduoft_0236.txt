8. When we say that the King alone has the power of making
Laws, we do not mean that the King’s mere pleasure has the force of
Law3 for there is required, besides, the consent of the People, and
other things, to make a law, as will be shewn. But we mean that
Resolutions of other branches of the community, (as Oommonasty,
Senate, Nobles,) except confirmed by the Royal Authority‚ have not
the force of Law, and do not bindthe subJect: whereas, certain Reso-
lut10ns of this kind, passed in due order and due form, as soon as they
have received the Royal Consent, do forthwith receive the name, form,
and authority of Law3 and, as soon as they are promulgated, do bind
the people. Hence the Will of the Prince is the sole and complete
Efficicnt Cause of Laws. For that is the Efficient Cause of anything,
which produces that thing of itself and immediately, or which in-
troduces, into the Ilsattcr fitly prepared, that Form which gives the
name and essence3 even if other concurrent or antecedent conditions
be necessary to dispose the matter to receive that form.

[The necessity of the Royal Gonsent as the last step in making
English Laws, is used to prove that the King’s Will is the Efficient
Oause of Laws3 and the consent of Parliament is reduced to the rank
of an antecedent condition,—an operation which prepares the Μαίων
to receive the Form of Law. This was not a just representation
of the English constitution, even under the Stuarts. The Consent

of Pa]rliament was as requisito in Legislati0n‚ as the Gonsent of the
King.
