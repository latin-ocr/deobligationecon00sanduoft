College‚Oxford.1s.6d.

“Mr Sidgwick’ 5 editing of the Sixth Book of Ovid' 5 Fasti furnishes a careful and serviceable
volume for average students. It eschews‘ construes’ which supersede the use of the dictionary,
but gives full explanation of grammatical usages and historical and mythical allusions, besides
illustrating peculiarities of style, true and salse derivations‚ and the more remarkable variations ot

the text. ''—Saturday Review.

“It 1s eminently good and useful.. ,The Introduction ι5 singularly clear on the astronomy of
Ovid, which is properly shown to be ignorant and confused; there is an excellent little map os
Rome, giving just the places mentioned in the text and no more; the notes are evidently written

by a practical schoolmaster.' ¹—lee Academy.

that ι5 likely to be useful to a young student; and, wherever we have examined his notes, we
have found them eminently practical and satisfying.. . The book may well be recommended sor
careful study' ln school or college.' ⁹-Saturday Review.

“The notes are scholarly, short, and a real help to the most elementary beginners in Latin
prose. ”— lee E xaminer.
