MISOELLANEOUS.
A CATALOGUE OF ANCIENT MARBLES IN GREAT

BRITAIN‚ by Prof. ADOLF MICHAELIS.

Translated by C. A. M.

FENNELL, M.A.‚ late Fellow of Jesus College. Royal 8vo. Roxburgh

(Morocco back), Az. 25.

“The object of the present work of Mich-
aelis is to describe and make known the vast
treasures of ancient sculpture now accumulated
in the galleries of Great Britain, the extent and
value os which are scarcely appreciated, and
chiefly so because there has hitherto been little
accessible information about them. To the
loving labours of a learned German the owners
vof art treasures in England are for the second
time indebted for a full description of their rich

ssessions. Waagen gave to the private col-
ections of ictures the advantage of his in-
spection anti> cultivated acquaintance with art,
and now Michaelis performs the same office
for the still less known private hoards of an-
tique sculptures for which our country is so
remarkable. The book is beautifully executed‚
and with its few handsome plates, and excel-
lent indexes, does much credit to the Cam-

bridge Press. It has not been printed in

German, but appears for the first time in the
English translation. All lovers of true art and
of good work should be grateful to the Syndics
of the University Press for the liberal facilities
afforded by them towards the productiori of
this important volume by Professor Michaelis.”
-Saturday Revt'ew.

“‘Ancient Marbles' here mean relies of
Greek and Roman origin which have been
imported into Great Britain from classical
soil. How rich this island is in respect to
these remains of ancient art, every one knows,
but it is equally well known that these trea-
sures had been most inadequately described
before the author os this work undertook the
labour of description. Professor Michaelis has
achieved so high a fame as an authority in
Classical archaeology that it seems unneces-
sary to say how good a book this is.¹'—- The
Antiquam.

LECTURES ΟΝ TEACHING‚ delivered in the University

of Cambridge in the Lent Term, 1880.
Majesty's Inspector of Schools.

“The lectures will be found most interest·
-in ‚ and deserve to be carefully studied‚ not
on y by persons directly concerned with in-
struction, but by parents who wish to be able
to exercise an intelligent judgment in the
choice of schools and teachers for their chil-
dren. For ourselves, we could almost wish to
be of school age again, to learn history and
geography from some one who could teach
thern after the pattern set by Mr Fitch to his
audience . . . But perhaps Mr Fitch’s observa-
tions on the general conditions of school-work
are even more important than what he says on
this or that branch of study.”—Saturday Re-
vzew.

“ It comprises fifteen lectures, dealing with
such subjects as organisation, discipline, ex-
amining, language‚ fact knowledge, science,
and methods of instruction3 and though the
lectures make no pretention to systematic or
exhaustive treatment, they yet leave very little
of the ground uncovered; and they combine in
an admirable way the exposition of sound prin-
ciples with practical suggestions and illustra-
tions which are evidently derived from wide
and varied experience, both in teaching and in
examining.’'—-Scotsman.

By J. G. FITCH, M.A.‚ Her
Crown 8vo. New Edition. 5s.

“ As principal of a training college and as a
Government inspector of schools, Mr Fitch has
got at his fingers’ ends the working of primary
education, while as assistant commissioner to
the late Endowed Schools Commission he has
seen something of the machinery of our higher
schools . . . Mr Fitch's book covers so wide a
field and touches on so many burning questions
that we must be content to reconimend it as
the best existing vade mecum for the teacher.
. . . He is always sensible, always judicious‚
never wanting in tact . . . Mr Fitch is a scholar:
he pretends to no knowledge that he does not
possess: he brings to his work the ripe expe-
rience of a well-stored mind, and he possesses
in a remarkable degree the art of exposition.''
—Pall Mall Gazette.

“Therefore, without reviewing the book for
the second time, we are glad to avail ourselves
of the opportunity of calling attention to the
re-issue of the volume in the five-shilling form,
bringing it within the reach of the rank and
file of the profession. We cannot let the oc-
casion pass without making special reference to
the excellent section on ‘punishments' in the
leclnure on ‘ Discipline.' ”—Schoolssoard C hron-
zc e.

THEORY AND PRACTICE OF TEACHING‚ By the
Rev. EDWARD THRING, M.A.‚ Head Master of Uppingham School,

late Fellow of King's College, Cambridge.

“Any attempt to summarize the contents of
the volume would fail to give our readers a
taste of the pleasure that its perusal has given
us.''—J0urnal os E ducation.

“In his book we have something very dif-
ferent from the ordinary work on education.
It is full of life. It comes fresh from the busy
workshop of a teacher at once practical and
enthusiastic‚ who has evidently taken up his
pen, not for the sake of writing a book, but

under the compulsion of almost passionate
earnestness, to give expression to his views
on questions connected with the teacher‘s life
and work. For suggestiveness and clear in·
cisive statement of the fundamental problems
which arise in dealing with the minds of chil-
dren, we know of no more useful book for any
teacher who is willing to throw heart, and
conscience, and honesty into his work.''—New
York E vening Post.
