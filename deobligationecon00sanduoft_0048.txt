24 DE DEFINITIONE CONSOIENTIAE.

missum fuisse animadverti. Pertinet ergo omnino ad potentiam
c09nitivam practicam, hoc est, ad Intellectum practicam.
Quemadmodum Aristoteles, postquam virtutes morales sta-
tuisset in Potentia Appetitiva ,· habitus tamen Artis et Pru-
dentiae, etsi ordinentur ad praxin, collocavit nihilominus in
Potentia Ooynitiva, libro Ethicomtm quinto. Firmant hanc
sententiam et ista3 quod Conscientia sit quaedam Scientia, et 1
Scientia omnis est in Intellecta .· quod capax sit erroris‘, et 2
error est morbus Intellectus .· quod ex communi usu loquendi, 3

(Nicom. Eth. V. 4, 5) although they tend to practice. In like manner,
though the Moral Virtues are Habits of the Appetitive Power, Con-
Science is a Habit of the Cognitive Power.

Our Author adds, as arguments in confirmation of this:

(1) Conscience = Con-science, is a kind of knowledge, and know-
ledge is in the Intellect.

(2) Conscienoe is capable of errour, and errour is a disease of the
Intellect.

(3) He who knows any one's secrets is conscious of them.

And thus the seat of Conscience is in the Practical Intellect:
Art. (D) and (E) of the Definition. ¹ .

On the division, here adopted, of the Faculties of the soul into
the Intellect (speculative and practical,) and the Will, we may observe,
that the Will is by no means a term well suited to designateour
Springs of Action different from the Intellect, which is what the
author intends, or at least what his argument requires him to intend.
The Appetitive Power of Aristotle, which is explained by him as in-
cluding Desire and Anger (ἦ ἐπιθυμία καὶ ὁ θυμὸςι De Anima, ΙΙΙ. 9),
serves somewhat better to describe these Springs of action3 yet not
’ very we113 for it does not seem suitable to class Anger under the
Appetitive Part, and there are many Desires (as the desire of Money,
of Honour, and the like,) which are very different from Appetites.
There is not, even now, any single word which conveniently describes
this part of human nature. It includes what are, in the Elements
of Morality, termed the Appetites or Bodity Desires, the Affections, and
the Mental Desires, (Elem. Moral. Art. 26-55).

The Will (Ε. M. Art. 61) is not rightly classed among the Springs
of Action. The Will is the step between the Springs of Action and
the Act. By speaking of the Will, instead of the Affections and
Desires, Sanderson has been led to regard Free Will (Liberum Arbi-
trium) as a Power of the Affections or Desires, and thus to confuse his
argument.

Moreover Conscience includes, not only a habit of the Practical
Intellect, as Sanderson says, but also certain Sentiments ; namely, a
Sentiment of Approbation and Esteem for what is right, and of Dis-
approbation and Indignation for what is wrong (E. M. Art. 56).
