“To Dr Lumby we must give raise unqualified and unstinted. He has done his work
admirably ..... Every student of istm-y, everfy olitician, every social reformer, every one
interested in literary curiosities, every lover o nglish should buy and carefully read Dr
Lumby's edition of the ‘Utopia.’ We are afraid to say more lest we should be thought ex-
travagant‚ and our recommendation accordingly lose part of its force.''——The Teacher.

“ lt was originally written in Latin and does not find a place on ordinary bookshelves. A very
great boon has therefore been conferred on the general English reader by the managers of the
Pitt Press Series, in the issue of a convenient little volume of More’s Utopz'a not in the original
Latin, but in the quaint English Translation thereos made by Rapke Robynson, which adds a
linguistic interest to the intrinsic merit of the work. . . . All this has been edited in a most com-
plete and scholarly fashion by Dr J R. Lumby, the N orrisian Professor of Divinity, whose name
alone is a sufficient warrant for its accuracy. It is a real addition to the modern stock of classica}
English literature.''—Guardian.
