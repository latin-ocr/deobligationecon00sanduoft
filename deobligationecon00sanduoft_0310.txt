286 DE LEGUM ‘HUMANARUM CAUSA FINALI.

ipsi, ubi Reipublicae salus palam periclitaretur, regni popu·-
lique sibi a Deo commissi saluti consulere, etiam contra verba
Le9is. Non quod liceat subditis, tuendae libertatis obtentu,
Leyum et omnia fidelitatis vincula abrumpere, et Reyiam auc-
toritatem intolerando fastu sub pedibus conculcare: Sed quod
Principi liceat, tuendae suae subditorumque salutis causa,
strictam Leyum observantiam ad tempus seponere, et arbi-
trario jure aliquantisper uti3 ne ex nimium superstitiosa et
intempestiva Le9um reverentia, seque et subditum sibi popu-
lum, ipsasque etiam Leyes, in hostium potestatem devenire

atiatur.

tamen, licentiam aliquam ipsis subditis eo Aphorismo concedi,
ut posthabitis Leyibus‚ ita postulante necessitate, saluti pub-
licee consulant: non tamen inde effici, quod nonnulli voluerunt.
Non quasi subditis liceret, ubi libertatem suam in aliqua re
laesam aut sentiunt, aut sentire se vociferantur, mox omnia
Leyum et officii repagula disjicere, et inconsulto Principe
arma rapere, tumultibusque et seditionibus omnia complere.
Sed quod pro salute Principis et sua adversus externos
hostes aut perduelles domesticos tuenda, (ubi tam gravis pre-

self so bound by the fetters of law, but that, when the safety of the
State is in danger, he can consult such safety, committed to him by
God, even by transgressing the words of the Law. The meaning is,
not that the Subjects may, under pretext of defending Liberty, break
all bonds of Law, and trample on the Royal Authority: but that the
Prince may, for the sake of defending his own Safety, and that of his
SubJects, deviato from a strict observance of the Laws, and for a time
act arbitrarily 3 in order that he may not by a superstitious and un-
reasonable reverence for the laws, allow himself and his subJects, and
the very Laws themselves, to be destroyed.

19. Tha-dim Supposing further, what still we do not grant, that
this maxim allows some licence to the SubJects, to deviate from the
Laws when necessity requires, and to act for the public Safety3 still
this would not lead to the conclusion which some draw from it. It
leads to this, that in cases where the defence of the Safety of the Prince
and their own, against foreign and domestic enemies, imposes a neces-
sity, (the necessity being so great that a pious and prudent man can-
not doubt that the Legislator, if he were present, would concede
a relaxation of the Law 3) the subJects may attend rather to that com-
mon Utility, which is the Supreme Law and the end of all Law, than
to particular Laws, which are made to serve, and not to prejudice, that
public Utility.
