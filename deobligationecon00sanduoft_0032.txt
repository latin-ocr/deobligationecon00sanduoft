8 DE DEFINITIONE CONSOIENTIAE.

Scientia quaedam est, et ab ea dicta, non parum nobis adju-
mento fuerit vocis Scientioe ὁμωνυμίαν paulo diligentius ape-
ruisse3 ut ex simplicis vocabuli multiplici usu, compositi
nominis ambiguitas rectius et penitius intelligatur.

VIII. Primo ergo (ut Habituum nomina familiariter
transeunt in sua objecta .·) Scientia dupliciter sumitur3 for-
maliter, et objective. Quemadmodum enim de Fide distin-
guere solent Theologi, aliam esse Fidem qua credimus,
quae est habitus fidei inmente existens3 aliam quam credimus,
quae est res fide credita, velut objectum prioriS, et ei extrin-
secum quid3 quarum illa dici potest fides formaliter sumpta,
haec objective .- pari omnino ratione de Scientia distinguere
licet, et consequenter de Conscientia. Utramque scilicet sumi
vel proprie et formaliter, pro ipso mentis habitu quo rem
aliquam scimus vel conscimus ; vel improprie et objective, pro
re illa quam scimus vel conscimus. Quo posteriore et im-
proprio sensu, Lem illa quae cordibus inscripta est velut recte
vivendi regula dici potest Conscientia. Et in hoc sensu
intelligendum est illud Damasceni in Scholis pervulgatissi-
mum, Conscientiam esse leyem mentis ‚· quum tamen Lea·
mentis non sit proprie et formaliter Conscientia, sed potius
Conscientioe objectum, aut adaequatum, aut partiale.

IX. Secundo, cum ad animam pertineant tria haec, dis-

8. Science is understood in two senses, which our author distin-
guishes as formal and objective. Some modern readers would under-
stand the distinction better if, for these terms, we were to substitute
subjective and objective: others would be repelled by either of these
technical modes of expression. Yet the distinction is a real and
important one, and is not easily kept steadily in view without the use
of technical expressions.

As the author observes, Faith. is in like manner understood in two
semes, as the act of believiny and the matter believed. The former ap-
plies the term to the subject, the mind, the latter to the object, the
creed. In the same way, it may be remarked that, Justice, Truth, and
other moral terms, have a subjective and an objective sense. See
Elements ofMorality, Art. 1. 26.

In like manner, Scienee is a habit of the mind by which we know,
or it is the matter which we know. As connected with this latter
sense, Conscience would mean the Law written on the heart3 but in the
former and more proper sense, the Law is not Conscience, but is the
object of Conscience.

χ 9. Besides this distinction of knowledge as it is something in the
mind which kuows, and knowledge as it is an object which is known,
