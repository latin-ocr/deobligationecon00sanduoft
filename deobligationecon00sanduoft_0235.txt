In a Monarchy the Sovereignty is in the King alone 3 and so
Peter says (1 Pet. ii. 13), to the Kiozy as Suprema, thus explaining what
Paul means by the Hiqher Powers (Rom. xiii. 1).

In 1 Sam. viii., when the Israelites asked for a king, the prophet
explained to them that the king’s power would be absolute, and his
government oppressive. And he implied that if the king were, even
without just cause, and of his mere will, to perform the oppressive and
rapacious acts there enumerated, and be a tyrant instead of a king,
though he would not be guiltless before God, he would not be ac-
countable to man. It would be an abuse of his power, but still, of
power which was his.

And, says Sanderson, it is quite clear that in England the Sove-
reignty of the three kingdoms belong to the King. We call him His
MaJ'esty, which implies Sovereignty. And in the sanctions of Laws,
and the formularies of Law, we speak of him as over all persons and
in all causes within his dominicus supreme.

[Although Sanderson, in succeeding Sections, modifies and limits
this idea of the King’s Sovereignty, so as to recognize the other ele-
ments of the English constitution, yet we see, by the reference to 1 Sam.
viii„ and the inference of the duty of non—resistanee that he is prac-
tically indisposed to set any bounds to the Royal Power in England.
His use of the term Sovereiynty favours this tendency: for though
sometimes, as in Sect. 8., it is made to mean only the necessity of
the Royal Gonsent in legislation, in other places the Sovereignty is
identified with the Legislative Power.]
