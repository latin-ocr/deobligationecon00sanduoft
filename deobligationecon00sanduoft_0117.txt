PRAELEGTIO QUARTA. 93

subjecto per proximam sui causam demonstrare, etsi nequeat
ulterius ascendere. At illo modo tum demum recta est Con-
scientia, cum et ipsa reyulce suoe proaimce conformis est, et
illa insuper regula reyuloe primce: quemadmodum is dicitur
habere rei alicujus certam, (id est perfectam,) scientiam, qui
omnes ejus causas novit usque ad primas. Tunc enim
unamquamque rem scire dicimur, (inquit Philosophus initio
Lib. 1. Phys-ia), cum omnes ejus causaS, principia, et ele-
menta coqnoscimus usque ad prima. Proinde ut certitudo
scientiae, etsi oriatur immediate ex cognitione causoe proximce,
resolvitur tamen ultimate in cognitionem causae primce .· Sic
rectitudo Conscientiae, etsi attendatur immediate penes con-
formitatem ad reyulam suam prooeimam, resolvitur tamen
ultimate in requiam suam primam et supremam.

both it is conformable to its proximate Rule, and also tho proximate
Rule to the Primary Rule.

This is illustrated by the case of knowledge or scionce. He is
said to have certain and true knowledge of any attribute, who can
prove it to be true of its subject by means of its proximate cause,
though he cannot ascend higher in the series of causes. But he only
has certain, that is, perfect knowledge of this, who knows all tho
causes, up to the first cause. He quotes Aristotle, Phys. 1. 1, τότε γὰρ
οἰόμεθα γινώσκειν ἕκαστον ὅταν τὰ αἴτια γνωρίσωμεν τὰ πρῶτα καὶ τὰς ἀρχὰς
τὰς πρώτας καὶ μέχρι τῶν στοιχείων.

And thus, as the Certainty of Knowledge, though it arise imme-
diately from the certainty of the proximate cause, is yet resolved
ultimately into the knowledge of the first cause3 so the Rightness
of Conscience, though it imply immediately conformity to its proxi-
mate mle, is ultimately resolved into its primary and supreme
rule.

[The doctrine that the conformity of Conscience to its proximate
rule makes it relatively right, but that the conformity of the proxi-
mate rule to the primary rule is requisite in order to make it abso-
lutely right, is sound Morality3 but Sanderson has not sufficiently
illustrated by examples what he means by the proximate and what by
the ulterior Rules of conscience.

The attempt to illustrate the subject by a reference to the kinds
of knowledge cannot now be considered as throwing much light on the
subJect. Aristotle's views of the nature of Science cannot be substan-
tiated by referring to actual Sciences, such as we now have, and such
as had hardly begun to exist in Aristotle's time. We now know,
by such examples, that Science does not consist in the knowledge of
successive orders of causes up to the first cause.

Of the Conscience as possessing a proximate but not an ultimate
authority, see Elements of Morality, Art. 269, &c.]
