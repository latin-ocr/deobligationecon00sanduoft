took the principal of them prisoners. He rightly judged, that in such
a critical necessity, the observance os the Law was unreasonable. He
acted with an eye to Public Utility, and made everything bend to the
Supreme Law, the safety of the Oountry. But having done this, in
order that the Authority of the Law might not fall into slight in con-
sequence of this example, justified by its special necessity3 and knowing
what a grave legal offence his was, according to the rigour of the Law,
he was not satisfied to rest in his good conscience as to what he had
done, but took care to provide both for his own safety and for the
prevention of evil from the example. He forthwith hastened to the
King (James 1.), begged for his pardon, and, as was reasonable, ob-
tained, not so much pardon for having violated the Law, as praise for
having preferred to it the public safety.
