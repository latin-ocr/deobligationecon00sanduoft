15. In reply to the above doctrine we say,

First, that the authority of the Supreme Governor, in whatever

manner acquired, proceeds from God‚ and by no means from the
People.
This appears from Scripture. See the passages, Prov. viii. 15,
Rom. xiii. 1, 4, 63 Psalm lxxxii. 6, I have said, Ye are yods ,· addressed
to the Rulers, as the representatives of God, from whom their authority
is, not from the suffrages of the People.

A man who has authority deputes it to his representative ac-
cording to his authority, not according to the will of any other:
and he who is to be the minister of God, and in place of God‚
cannot receive his power from any other than God. For a People to
pretend to constitute its own Rulers, is to make itself gods 3 which is
idolatry.

This does‘not exclude the People having a voice in selecting the
person, of which we shall afterwards speak. The ›S‘uly‘ect in which the
Power is to be invested, may be determined by other conditione 3 just
as there are previous dispositione which prepare the Matter to receive
the Form, but yet the production of the Form in the Subject Matter
is the immediate work of the Agent. And thus, the conferring the
Governing Power is the work of God, whatever conditione determine
