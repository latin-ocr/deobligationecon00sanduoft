THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST MATTHEW. By the
Rev. A. cmm, M.A. With4Maps. 4s. 6d.

“ With the ‘ Notes‚’ in the volume before us, we are much pleased ; so far as we have searched,
they are scholarly and sound. The quotations from the Classics are apt; and the references to
modern Greek form a pleasing feature.''— The Clzurclzman.

“Copious illustrations, gathered from a great variety os sourceS, make his notes a very valu-
able aid to the student. They are indeed remarkably interesting, while all explanations on
ῐιῐυιεῗὶιὲῧὲεἰί ἓρρίἰοειῐὶοιιε, and the like are distinguished by their lucidity and good sense.'’—

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST MARK. By the Rev.
G. F. MACLEAR, D.D. With 3 Maps. 45. 6d.

“The Cambridge Greek Testament, of which Dr Maclear's edition of the Gospel according to
St Mark is a volume, certainly supplies a want. without pretending to compete with the leading
commentaries, or to embody very much original research‚ it forms a most satisfactory introduction
to the study os the N ew Testament in the original . . . Dr Maclear’s introduction contains all that
is known of St Mark’s life, with references to passages in the New Testament in which he is
mentioned; an account of the circumstances in which the Gospel was composed, with an estimate
of the influence of St Peter’s teaching upon St Mark: an excellent sketch of the special character-
istics of this Gospel ; an analysis, and a chapter on the text of the New Testament generally . . .

The work is completed by three good maps.”—Saturday Review.
“The Notes‚ which are admirably put together, seem to contain all that is necessary sor the

guidance of the student, as well as a judicious selection of passages from various sources illustrat-
ing scenery and manners.”-Academy.

PLUMMER, M.A., D.D. With 4 Maps. 6s.

“ A valuable addition has also been made to ‘The Cambridge Greek Testament sor Schools,’

and embody the results of much thought and wide reading. ’'—Expositon
