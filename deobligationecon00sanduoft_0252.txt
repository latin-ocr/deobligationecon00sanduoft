228 DE LEGUM HUMANARUM CAUSA EFFICIENTE.

ita abrogari posse constat per contrariam consuetudinem, ut
ultra obligare desinant: quae consuetudo nihil aliud est quam
conjuncta populi consensio eam legem ut inutilem observare
negligentiS, et consensio principis observationem ejus non
exigentis. Ergo quum sit ejusdem potestatis construere et
destruere, videtur leyum vis ex approbatione et consensu
populi non minimum pendere. Quarto et praecipue, quia hoc 4·
ipsum (scilicet ut ad Leges condendas concurrat una cum
Principis potestate consensus etiam populi) et ad publicam
totius reqni pacem, et ad salutem securitatemque Principis
in tantum conducit, ut nihil magis, Omnino enim verisimile
est subditos univerSOS‚ Reyibus qui ipsorum consensum expec-
taverint, et Leyibus in quas ipsi consenserint, prompte et
alacriter, nec gravate parituros, Neque vero imminutum iri
isthoc pacto supremam Principis νομοθετικῆν potestatem
(quod unum objici ex adversa parte solet) verendum est.
Posse enim duo haec, (populi inquam consensum et supre-
mam Principis in ferendis Legibus potestatem) simul et
amice satis consistere, (praeterea quod in rebus ipsis nulla
videtur esse repugnantia,) vel inde constare potest; quod
Anylioe nostrae Re9e8‚ quorum supremam potestatem ante
infelicissima haec tempora omnes hujus Regni incolae prolix-
issime semper agnoverunt, nunquam tamen Zeyislativam suam

is nothing else but the consent of the People disregarding the Law,
Joined with the consent of the Prince not insisting upon the Lawt
and thus, since it belongs to the same power- to construet and to
destroy, the validity of the Law must also depend on the consent of
the People.

Fourthly, and principally: Because the rule, that the consent of
the People should concur with the power of the Prince in making
Laws, is in the highest degree conducive to the peace and wellbeing of
the state, and the security of the Prince. It is likely that subJects
‘will obey with alacrity Kings who have waited for their consent, and
Laws which have received their consent.

Nor does this condition impair the power of the PrInce. That the
consent of the People and the Sovereignty of the Prince may concur
harmoniously in the making of Law, appears by the example of
England3 for the sovereignty of the Kings of England was never
questioned till these late unhappy timeS, but yet they never exercised
their legislative power without consent of the People.

[The assumption on which the Third Reason is founded, that
Laws may become obsolete by disuse, obtains among the Jurists of
several countries, but is not accepted by the English Lawyers.]
