display of technical method, is very deficient in phi-

11, 12, 153 and especially, Lect. II, Sect. 13 a pas-

may be able to follow the argument. In the greater
part of the work I have inclosed in [brackets] the
additional portions of the N otes which Ι have added
for the sake of further explanation and illustration;
