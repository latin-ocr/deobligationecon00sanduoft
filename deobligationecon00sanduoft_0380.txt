and V. With a Map and English Notes by ALFRED PRETOR‚ M.A.‚ Fellow
of St Catharine's College, Cambridge ; Editor of Persius and Cicero ad Atti-
cum Book 1. 2s. each.

“In Mr Pretor’s edition of the Anabasis the text of Kiihner has been followed in the main,
while the exhaustive and admirable notes of the great German editor have been largely utilised.
These notes deal with the minutest as well as the most important difficulties in construction, and
{ill questions of history, antiquity, and geography are briefly but very effectually elucidated.”— The

ngeaewelcome this addition to the other books of the Anabasis so ably edited by Mr Pretor.
Although originally intended for the use of candidates at the university local examinations, yet
this edition will be found adapted not only to meet the wants of the junior student, but even ’
advanced scholars will find much in this work that will repay its perusal.”- The S choolmaster.

“Mr Pretor's ‘Anabasis os Xenophon, Book IV.’ displays a union of accurate Cambridge
scholarship‚ with experience of what is required by learners gained in examining middle-class
schools. The text is large and clearly printed, and the notes explain all difficulties. . . . Mr
Pretor's notes seem to be all that could be wished as regards grammar, geography, and other
matters.’'—- lee Academy.

BOOKS II. VI. and VII. By the same Editor. 25. 6d. each.

“Another Greek text, designed it would seem for students preparing for the local examinations,
is ‘Xenophon’s Anabasis,' Book ΙΙ., with English Notes‚ by Alfred Pretor, M.A. The editor has
exercised his usual discrimination in utilising the text and notes of Kuhner, with the occasional
assistance of the best hints of Schneider, Vollbrecht and Macmichael on critical matters, and of
Mr R. W. Taylor on points of history and geography. . . When Mr Pretor commits himself to
Commentator's work, he is eminently helpful. . . Had we to introduce a young Greek scholar
to Xenophon, we should esteem ourselves fortunate in having Pretor's text-book as our chart and
guide.'’—Contempora⁷3v R eview.
