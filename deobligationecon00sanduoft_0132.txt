108 DE ADAEQUATA GONSOIENTIAE REGULA.

quod in Fidei doqmatibus‚ et rebus ad salutem necessariis
Traditiones obtrudant non Scriptas, cum scripto Dei verbo
pari veneratione recipiendas: quasi non ex se valeret σοφίσαι
εἰς σωτηρίαν, et conferre filiis Dei paternam hoereditatem
Christi Testamentum, sine affixis humanarum Traditionum,
codicillis Eos autem qui a Scripturis neyative disputant,
de rebus ad salutem necessario credendis aut ayendis intelli-
gendos esse, siquidem uti debent, eo utantur argumento,
Ceterum nunc non de fidei reyula quaeritur‚ sed Conscientiae.-
nec de ejus Reyula praecipua, sed adaequata: nec quid homini
Christiano sit necessario credendum vel ayendum ad conse-
quendam animae salutem, sed quid a viro pio et prudente
licite fieri possit vel non pro hic et nunc. Summa est, Scrip-
turam sacram esse fidei et supernaturaliter credendorum,
actionum item moralium, qua ex parte Spirituales sunt et ad
finem supernaturalem ordinantur, adaequatam reculam. ; esse
etiam Conscientiae Zeyem et agendorum moralium requiam
praecipuam et supremam, ita ut ubi Scriptura de re quavis
aliquid in universum statuit praecipiendo prohibendove, non

such as have been often used both by the ancient Fathers of the
Church, and the most learned Theologians of modern times.

We reply, that the Papists derogate from the perfection of Scrip-
ture, in that they obtrude unwritten Traditions in respect to doctrines
of Faith, and matters necessary to salvation: whereas the Scriptures
alone are able to make us wise unto salvation. We hold that those who
dispute negatively from Scripture, if they reason rightly, use such
arguments, only to prove what we must necessarily believe or do, in
order that we may be saved3 namely, arguing that nothing which
is not revealed or enjoined in-Scripture is necessary for that pur-
pose.

But here we do not inquire concerning the Rule of Faith, but
the Rule of Conscience3 nor concerning the principa] Rule, but the
complete Rule; nor what it is necessary for a Christian man to
believe or to do for the salvation of his soul; but what may law-
fully and prudently be done by a pious and prudent man under
present circumstances. .

The sum of the matter is, that Scripture is the complete Rule of
Faith, and of things to be believed on supernatural grounds, and of
moral actions, so far as they are spiritual, and are directed to a
supernatura] end; that Scripture is also the principal and supreme
Rule of moral actions, so that when Scripture has commanded or
forbidden anything in general, no other Law can annul this: but
that Scripture is not so far the only Rule of Conscience, that what
is not commanded there is necessarily unlawful.
