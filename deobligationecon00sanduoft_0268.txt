24:4³ DE PROMULGATIONE LEGUM.

qentia, quum id suo vitio et lata σπῖρα contingat ut eam
nesciat, nihilo aut saltem non multo minUS, et peccati reum
esse, et poenam mereri, quam eum qui cognitam legem violat.
Iynoromtia enim crassa ejus quod quis scire debet et potest,
neminem excusat: nec multum distare videntur (juris inter-
pretatione) dolus maluS, et lata culpa.

VIII. Dico εσσπηεῖο, eum qui leyem propterea iynorat,
quia aliquanto incuriosior aut neyliyentior in eam partem
fuerit, quam in re tam gravi oportuerat; etsi culpa, quam
J urisconsulti levem vel etiam levissimam dicunt3 quia et culpa

a leyis obliyatione. Ratio est, quia, istiusmodi iynorantia
fuit vincibilis: si enim subditus tantam diligentiam adhibuisset,
quantam et rei ipsius dignitas postulabat, et adhibere solent in
gravioribus suis negotiis homines cauti, potuisset (id enim jam
supponimus) certus fuisse de Zeyis promulyatione. Vincibilis
autem ignorantia ejus juris, secundum quod tenetur quisque
diriyere actiones suas, non potest non esse culpabilis: si
vero culpabilis in quocunque demum gradu, eatenus etiam
et inexcusabilis est. Quo tamen levior σπῖρα est, eo et in

only oblige those whom it can direct, and can only direct those to
whom it is known.

In reply, we say: First, He who is ignorant of the Law by gross
negligence, is ignorant by his own fault3 and is both as culpable and
as punishable as those who know the Law. For gross ignorance» of
what he ought to have known and might have known, excuses no man.
[See Elem. Moral. Art. 359.]

8. Secondly ; He who is ignorant of the Law through some want
of the care and curiosity concerning such grave things, which men
ought to have; although he is culpable only in a slight or very slight
degree, yet being culpable, is not free altogether from the obligation
of the Law. For his ignorance was not invincible. [Elem. Μοναῖ.
Art. 343.] And vincible ignorance of the Rules by which we ought to
direct our actions cannot be otherwise than culpable. But in pro-
portion as he is less culpable‚ he is more excusable3 and his ignorance
will be more excused both in the external forum of Law, and the inter-

nal forum of Conscience.
¹ But that he was obliged by the Law before he knew it, appears
from this3 that if he learn from good testimony that such a Law has
been promulgated, he forthwith judges himself to be obliged by the
Law. Now such mere testimony cannot produce an obligation3 there-
fore he was obliged by the Law before3 though he had then neither
knowlcge of the Law nor conscience of the Obligation.
