2 DE DEFINITIONE O ΟΝ SOIEN TIAE .

ΙΙ. Sed quum sit dupleoe methodus definitiva, altera
συνθετικὴ et ad Compositioriis modum, quae ex praemissa sin-
9ularum partium expensione, inteyram tandem colligit defini-
tionem ,· altera quasi ἁναλυτικὴ et per modum Resolutioriis,
quae propositam ab initio inteyram definitionem postea mem-
bratim aperit et explicat: etsi prior illa videri fortassis possit
ordini naturae convenientior, delegi tamen potius posteriorem,
quae visa est mihi ad docendum aliquanto commodior. Sic
ergo breviter definio Conscientiam: Conscientia est facultaS,

sive habitus intellectus practici, quo mens hominis per dis· ’

cursum rationis applicat lumen quod sibi adest ad particu-
lares suos aetus morales‘. Ubi consideranda veniunt suo
ordine3 prim0‚ Definiti nomen, nimirum ipsa Conscientiae vox:
deinde singula definitionis membra ,- illa videlicet omnia, quae
in definiendis primae vel ”secundae speciei Qualitatibus adhiberi
solent, Genus, Sabjectum, Objectum, et Actus Proprius.

 

 

2. The analytieal method which the author professes to adopt,
in declaring the nature of Conscience, is characterised by his stating
the whole Definition, before 116 proves the propriety of the several
parts of it. The Definitionis, in fact, rather a Theorem‚ which is to
be proved, and which is enunciated previous to the proof. In this
way, his analytical method agrees with what in Geometry is called
the synthetical method.

In speaking of the “first or second species of Qualities,” our author
has reference to Aristotle's Cateqories, and to his own explanation of
them in his Loyicae Artis Compendium. Quality is one of the ten
Predicaments3 (substance, Quantity, Quality, Relation, Action, Passion,
Place, Time, Position, Habit5) Quality is dlvided into four species,
ἕξις, δύναμις, πάθος, σχῆμα,· Habit, Power, Affection‚ Form. See Arist.
Catey. c. 5.

The author's Definition or Description of Conscience contains, as
we shall hereafter soffiffllyg-djsfianQ, which he subsequently
examines and establishes in order, as we shall afterwards see. It
stands thusx Conscience is a Faculty, or Habit of the practical Intellect,
by which the mind of Man doch, by Discourse of Reason, apply the Liyht
which is in it, to its own particular Moral Acts.

Jeremy Taylor, also, in Chapter 1. of his “Rule of Conscience,”
adopts this same ‘⁶ analytical'' method3 and gives a Definition or Rule
consisting 'of several phrases, each of which he afterwards illustrates
separately. His statement is this: (Chap. 1. Art. 1.)

Rule I. (a) Conscience is the Mind of a Man (b) yoverned by a
Bul& and (c) measured by the Propertions of Good and Evil, (d) in
Order to Praetice ‚· (e) viz. to conduct all oar Relations and Intercourse
between Geel, our neiyhbours and ourselves; that is, in all moral
Actione.
