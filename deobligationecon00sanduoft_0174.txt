150 DE LEGUM HUMANARUM OBLIGATIONE.

esse magis sollicitum; adeoque malle ipsum, ut praesentibus
rebus, quo salvi sint, se qua licet modeste accommodent,
quam ut potentiori in certam suam perniciem semet intem-

two years, and was now confined at Oarisbrook castle. His son, after-
wards Oharles ΙΙ., was an exile at the court of France. Cromwell,
though not yet Protector, might be considered as the most powerful
person in the kingdom. The government of the country was nomi-
nally in the hands of the Parliament. Sanderson's decision, as to the
duty of a subJect, may be regarded as moderate and reasonable, and
points out the course followed by himself and many of his royalist
friends. It agrees with the decision given in his Cases of Conscience,
respecting the Enyayement which the Parliament imposed, and which
ran thus: ‘⁶ I do promise to be true and faithful to the Oommonwealth
of England, as it is now established without King or Lords.'’ In an
opinion communicated to a friend, but not published till after his
death, he pronounces that a loyal person may take this engagement
‘⁶ in its lowest construction,” which is, that he will live quietly under
the protection of the Parliament, as being for the present possessed of
the supreme power. Nor was this an opinion taken up for the emer-
gency. He had already, as early as 1641, in his fifth Sermon acl
Populum, taught that the sovereign cle facto may be obeyed with a
good conscience.

But at the same time that he laid down this rule, or permission,
for men of peace, we cannot doubt that he thought those persons also
justified in conscience who took up arms on the royalist side. In-
deed in this direction he goes so far, that in his decision of the Caso
of C‘onscieme touching a Military Life, (whether such a life, as a Pro-
fession, be morally lawful,) he does not allo-w that anything can jus-
tify such a life except the command, or at least, the permission, of
“the Prince:” by which phrase, following earlier writers, he con-
stantly describes the Supreme Power in the State]

unlawful, human laws oblige the conscience directly and in general:
