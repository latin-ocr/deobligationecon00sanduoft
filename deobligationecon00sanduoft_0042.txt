1 8 DE DEFINITIONE CONSCIENTIAE.

bitum: unde sequitur Conscientiam Habitum· potius dicen-
dam esse quam Potentiam. Tertia, quia a meris Potentiis 3
nemo denominatur moraliter bonus aut malus, sed abs Habi-
tibus ; nec propter eas laudatur quis vel vituperatur, sed
propter hos : at dicuntur homines boni aut mali, laudan-
tur-que et vituperantur, pro qualitate Conscientiaram .· ergo
Conscientia est habitus. Quarta, quod Potentiarum non est, 4
scd Habitaum, acquiri, assumi, deponi, amitti: sed homines
dicuntur acquirere et amittere, assumere et deponere Con-
scientiam .- Conscientia igitur, non est Potentia, sed Ha-
bitus.

XVII. Statuo itaque Conscientiam proprie, formaliter
et praedicatione recta esse Habitum .· dici nihilominus posse
eandem et Potentiam, idque duplici ratione. Tum Mate-
rialiter, quia inest Potentioe, ut Subjecto ἐν ᾦτ tum per
approximationem; quia est Habitus Innatus; et Habitus
innatUS, in quantum medio quodam modo se habet inter
Habitum acquisitum et puram Potentiam, utriuslibet nomen
induere potest, ut solent Media participare de utroque Etc-
tremo. Hinc est quod Conscientia reperiatur in parvulis,

being instructed and enlightened we do not acquire a new Power,
but a new Habit.

Thirdly; in virtue of his mere Power, no one can bc termed
morally good or evil, but in virtue of his Habits3 praise and blame
are given on account of Habits, not of Powers ; but men arc called
good or bad, are praised or blamed, on account of their Conscience3
therefore Conscience is a Habit.

Fourthly3 Powers are not, and Habits are, acquired and lost,
assumed and laid aside3 but men are said to acquire or to lose, to
assume or to lay aside Conscience3 therefore conscience is not a
Power, but a Habit. .

17. But though Conscience is most properly a Habit, it may also
be called a Power, for two reasons. First, the Habit resides in a
corresponding Power, and supposes such a Power3 and secondly, the
Habit is an Innate Habit, and Innate Habits, lying between acquired
Habits and mere Powers, share of the nature of both, and may ap-
proximate to either. And because Conscience is an Innate Habit, it
may be found in children and infants, which are not capable of
Acquired Habits.

In answer to the argument from Tit. i. 15, it is replied that the
mind and conscience need not be sharply distinguished3 νοῦς ma)r mean
the speculative Intellect with its appurtenances3 συνείδησις, the prac-
tical Intellect with its faculties‚ habits, acts, διο.
