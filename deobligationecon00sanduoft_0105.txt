PRAELECTIO TERTIA. 81

fueritne yestus [tricliniaris] a Christo et Apostolis in prima ’

ccena adhibitus Imitabilis, vel non‘? Imitabilem fuisse (sat
scio) non negabunt, imo ne possunt quidem negare, qui inde
praecipuum causae suae firmamentum petunt: sic enim propo-
nunt Christi eoeemplum nobis de necessitate imitandum, non
omne simpliciter, sed omne quod est imitabile. Quod igitur
illi ultro largiuntur, libens accipio: et Propositionem, scilicet,
Omne Christi etnemplum imitabile obligare Christianos ad sui
imitationem3 et Assumptionem pariter, scilicet gestum illum
in speeie (sive fuerit ille tricliniaris, quod admodum probabile
est, et nunc saltem supponimuS, sive quis alius) quo Christus
in prima illa coena usus est, esse imitabilem. Ex his prae-
missis'sic colligo, Ergo vi istius exempli obligabantur proximi
post Christum seculi Christiani ad eundem ¹aestum in specie,
quo usus est Christus; ergo similiter obligabantur et secundi
seculi, itemque tertii et sic deinceps usque ad haec tempora.
Ergo et praesentem ecclesiam ad yestuwz tricliniarem in specie
obliyari fatendum est, si Christus eo gestu usus est: aut
saltem ostendendum est, quo tempore, qua ratione, quo auctore,
quo jure et auctoritate sublata sit illa obliyatia

Apostles in that first Lord's Supper were imitable, or not? Of course
they will allow it to be imitable, for that it is so, is the basis of their
whole argument: they say that every example of Christ which is
imitable, is to be imitated. We assume, then, this proposition, that
every imitable example of Christ obliges Christians to imitate it3 and
again, this other proposition, that the Posture of Christ in that first
Supper, (whether a reclining Posture, as is most probable, or any
other,) was imitable. Hence it follows, that by the force of Christ's
example, the Christians of the first century were obliged to adopt tho
same specific Posture which Christ used 3 and therefore, in like man-
ner, those of the second century3 and thence, those of the third 3 and
so on, up to our times. And therefore the Church at the present day
must be obliged to the same specific Posture; to the Reclining Posture,
if that were the Posture used by Christ: or if not, at least, it must
be shewn when that obligation ceased.
- In the beginning of this Sixth Argument of the present Article, I
conceive that the word tricliniaris interferes with the course of rea-
sonIng. 1 have therefore included it in brackets.

22. This argument, therefore, which has been brought forward
with so much pomp, amounts to this: that the example of Christ and
