PRAELEOTIO PRIMA. 23

Satis hactenus superque habuistis spinosarum subtilitatum.
Paucis itaque quod instituto meo expediat, expediam. Partis
intellectivae tres distinctas potentias enumerat Aristoteles libro
de Anima tertio .· duas sc. cognitivas‚ Intellectum Speculati-
vum, et Intellectum Praeticum3 et tertiam appetitivam, Volun-
tatem. Harum trium extremae sunt Intellectus SpeculativuS,
qui speculatur Verum quatenus Verum, et in eo acquiescit,
praecise, sine aliquo ordine aut respectu ad Opus .· et Vo-
luntas, quae praecise tendit ad operationem, nec omnino specu-
latur quicquam. Inter utramque hanc potentiam velut in
medio situs est Intellectus practicuS, qui pro more rerum me-
diarum, cum utraque eoetrema ex aliqua parte concordat, ex
aliqua ab ea discrepat. Concordat Intellectus practicus cum
speculativo in hoc, quod speculatur Veritatem ; cum Volun-
tate in hoc, quod tendit in operationem. Quod ad Conscien-
tiam attinet, illud imprimis certum est, non pertinere eam ad
Intellectum Speculativum, quia scientiam suam omnino dirigit
ad praxin. Ι N ec proprie pertinet ad Voluntatem : quia si hoc
esset, vel per modum Potentiae ei inesset, et sic esset idem
quod Liberum Arbitrium; vel per modum Habitus, et sic
esset aliqua Virtutum Moralium; quorum neutrum a quo-
quam vel Theologo vel philosopho assertum unquam aut ad-

 

 

Intellect, and the Will. The passage referred to appears to be that
in De Anima, 111. 103 where, however, this distinction is by no means
so precisely stated as was afterwards done by the Schoolmen. San-
derson points the distinction sufficiently, thus z

The speculative Intellect looks at Truth merely as Truth‚ and rests
in this contemplation merely, without regarding it as leading to
Action. The Will tends to Action merely, and does not contemplate
at all. The Praetical Intellect lies between these two, having some-
thing common with eachx it agrees with the Speculative Intellect in
contemplating truth3 it agrees with the Will in tending to action.

Now Conscience cannot belong to the Speculative Intellect, be-
cause it directs its knowledge altogether to action. It does not
belong to the Will: for if it were a Power of the Will, it would be
identical with Free Will; if it were a Habit of the Will, it would be
some one of the Moral Virtues, for these are Habits of the Will.
But no moralist ever asserted conscience to be either identical with
Free Will or with any of the Moral Virtues. Therefore Conscience
belongs to a Practical knowing Power, that is to the Praetical Intel-
lect.

Aristotle, after placing the moral Virtues in the Appetitive Power,
does afterwards assign Art and Prudence to the Knowing Power,
