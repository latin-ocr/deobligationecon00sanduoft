292 SALUS POPULI SUPREMA LEX.

hominis verecundiae, quod rogantibus amicis concesserim ε prae-

gratum fore se non dubitare.

V. Quid ergo sibi velit pervulgatum illud axioma, Salus
populi suprema Lex, et quomodo sit intelligendum expedire,
praesentis est negotii. Excuderunt intra paucos annos homines
non optime feriati, et in Rempublicam etiam tantem, ut ante
in Ecclesiam, invexerunt, novam una cum Theoloyia Poli-
ticam. Qui, ut sub obtentu libertatis Christianae (sive con-
scientiae,) totius regiminis Ecclesiastici ; ita sub obtentu

5. In recent times, he says, certain unhappy men have introduced a
new Theology and a new Polity into Ohurch and State3 they, under
the pretext of Christian Liberty, (or Conscience,) and Oivil Liberty,
(the Freedom of the subject) have shaken the edifice to its founda-

renown, (being at the same time under a strict and strong garrIson,
put over them by the Parliament ; the king in prison3 and all their
hopes desperate) passed a public act and declaration against the
Covenant, with such invincible arguments of the illegality, wickedness‚
and pei-jury contained in it, that no man of the contrary opinion, nor
the Assembly of the Divines, (which then sat at Westminster‚ forming

world’s end, as a monument of the learning, courage, and loyalty, of that
excellent place, against the highest malice and tyranny that waslever
exercised in or over any nation3 and which those famous commissioners
