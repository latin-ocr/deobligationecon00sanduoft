 

PRAELECTIO DECIMA. 2 93

libertatis civilis (sive subditorum‚) totius regiminis politici,
non modo vim omnem subnervare, sed ipsam quoque fabricam
ab imis fundamentis revulsam labefactare, in hac tanta rerum
perturbatione strenue hactenus conati sunt ; hodieque pergunt,
cum summo animorum ardore et terrore militari, conari. Hi,
quoties conculcatae sub pedibus Rcyioe diynitatis, spretae sanc-
tarum Leyum auctoritatis, perturbatae pacis publicae, ruptis

only answered by expelling all those who refused to submit to their juris-
diction, or to take the Covenant 3 which was, upon the matter, the whole
University3 scarce one governor and master of college or hall, and an
incredible small number of the follows, or scholars, submitting to either:
whereupon that desolation being made, they placed in their roonis the
most notorious factious presbyterians, in the government of the several
colleges or halls3 and such other of the same leaven in the fellow-
ships, and scholars' places, of those whom they had expelled, without
any regard to the statutes of the several founders, and the incapacities
of the persons that were put in. The omnipotence of an Ordinance of
Parliament confirmed all that was this way done 3 and there was no
farther contending against it.'’

The Declaration here referred to passed the Convocation unani-
mously, June 1, (o. s.) 1647, and is entitled, “The Reasons of the
University of Oxford against the Solemn League and Covenant, the
Negative Oath, and the Ordinances concerning Discipline and Wor-
ship.'’ It was principally drawn up by Sanderson: and is commonly
printed in his works.

Izaak Walton, in his Life of Sanderson, (with whom he was person-
ally acquainted,) speaks thus of his removal from Oxford:

“1 now return to Dr Sanderson in the chair in Oxford, where they
that complied not in taking the Oovenant, N egative Oath, and Parlia-
ment Ordinance for Church discipline and worship, were under a sad
and daily apprehension of expulsion 3 for the visitors were daily
expected, and both city and university full of soldiers, and a party of
presbyterian divines‚ that were as greedy and ready to possess, as the
ignorant and illnatured visitors were to eJect the dissenters out of their
Colleges and livelihoods: but notwithstanding Dr Sanderson did still
continue to read his lecture, and did to the very faces of those pres-
byterian divines and soldiers, read with so much reason, and with a
calm fortitude make such applications, as if they were not, they ought
to have been ashamed, and begged pardon of God and him, and for-
borne to do what followed. But these thriving sinners were hardened3
and as the visitors expelled the orthodox, they, without scruple or
shame, possest themselves of their Colleges3 so that with the rest,
Dr Sanderson was (in June 1648) forced to pack up and be gone,

and thank God he was not imprisoned, as Dr Sheldon‚ Dr Hammond‚
and others then were.”]
