PRAELECTIO QUINTA. 1 49

ingratissimum.‘ qumo potest duobus dominis servire, tam
adversa spectantibus3 quorum omn-ia vota, studia, consilia,
pronis in mutuam perniciem affectibuS‚ 111 contrarias partes

fore, injusto imperii possessori praestitum a cive, eo quo
dictum est modo, et intra dictos fineS, obsequium: quin
potius ipso consentiente sic fieri oportuisse praesumendum est.
Siquidem ejusmodi obsequiO, non tam injuste dominanti, quam
toti communitati, 1100 est, Reipublicae, serviisse existimandus
est: quam salvam esse, justi lzaeredis nihilo minus interest,
quam illius qui de facto in ea dominatur. Fortassean et
multo etiam magis, quo sincerius patriam diligere censendus
est, et ei bona omnia velle, qui genuinus patrioe pater est,

interested no less than the Usurper. Indeed we must suppose 1110
rightful heir to have more affection for the country than the Usurper3
the 0110 has 0 mother's feelings, the other, a step-mother's 3 and as in
the judgment of Solomon, the real mother would rather that the
‚child should be preserved under the care of another than be de-

provide for their safety by accommodating themselves to circum-

And thus, says Sanderson, you have my opinion on this grave and
,difficult question; which, however, I do not give as immutable, but
am prepared to be convinced if any one 0011 100011 1110 better.
