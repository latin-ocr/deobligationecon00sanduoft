aXiomate salutis appellatione veniat intelligendum. N on enim,
siquis aut diqnitatem suam aut libertatem, in re aliqua levi-
cula, vel etiam fortassis admodum gravi, laesam sentiat aut
sentire se putet3 illico salutis se jacturam fecisse, aut de
salute periclitari, jure conqueri poterit. Saluti enim alicujus
rei aut personae, non Zoesio quaevis, aut nocumentum, sed inter-
itus opponitur: ut Graecis τῇ σωτηρίᾳ ἡ ἀπώλεια. Quinimo
pariter omnino se res habet (servata utrinque debita analogia)
in corgoore politicO, et in Republica sicut in corpore humano
et persona singulari. Prae contrariarum qualitatum in humano
corpore pugna, ex aliquo interni calidi aut humidi eneces-su vel
defectu, et extrinsecus accidentium varia immutatione, vix
fieri potest ut quis tam integra valetudine usque perfruatur,
quin ut saepicule aliqua saltem corporis parte, interna vel ex-
terna, id patiatur, quod ei molestiam afferat: fieri etiam
potest, ut ex podayra, odontalyia, calculo, aut alio partium
morbo acutissimos sentiat dolore& vel etiam toto corpore
afflicto aeger decumbat3 ut interim non sit opportunum, nedum
necessarium, ad extrema quaeque remedia, ut in aperto vitae
salutisque discrimine, confugere. Sic in Republica, non est
mox aliquid attentandum contra loyes et jura, non contrahenda
vulgi colluvies et tumultus excitandi, non ad arma, ad arma
continuo conclamandum, ut saluti populi consulatur scilicet3
quam primum popularis aliquis tribunus, aut audaculus quis-

7. First, what is Salas? We reply, we are not to suppose that if
any one feels his dignity or his liberty wounded, in a slight, or even in
a grave matter, that it is forthwith a question of Salus, of Preservation 3
that his Safety is endangered or lost. The Safkty of anything or per-
son is opposed to, not Damage or Annoyance, but to Destructz'on.
And the same is the case in the Body Politic as in the human body.
Scarcely any one is constantly in perfect health3 he often suffers in-
disposition, or even pain, in some limb, or in the whole body: and yet
still is not in a condition in which it is wise to recur to extreme reme-
dies‚ as in a question of life or death. And so in the State, we are not,
merely because some demagogue accuses the Prince, N obles, Magis-
trates, Judges‚ or their Officers, of violated rights, neglected duties, or
the like, calumniously, nor even truly,-we are not therefore forthwith
to cry “To arms, To arms 1” and call upon men to stand up for the
Safety of the People. Even under the best of Kings, and in the best
constituted States, there always have been abuses of power, as, oppres-
sion of the weak, and other grievances3 nor can any care of Governors, or
any severity of Laws, entirely prevent or remedy this. If, as soon as an
instance or two of such a kind appear, it is forthwith thought allowable
