1 4³ DE DEFIN ITION E GONSOIENTIAE.

tatem in compendium fore reliquae tractationiS, quae in expli-
catione ipsius Definitionis per singula membra insumetur:
quam nunc proxime aggredior. Unum hoc duntaxat prae-

quate pertinere3 nimirum prout accipitur pro notitia ultimos

ἀναλογίαν aequivocis amat fieri. Fuit autem data definitiO,
quam propter tam multa interposita repetere libet, haec3
Conscientia est facultas vel habitus intellectus practici, quo
mens hominis per discursum rationis applicat lumen quod
sibi inest ad particulares suos actus morales. In qua
definitione quatuor ista continentur singillatim explicanda3
Genus, Subjectum, objectum, et Actus.

ledge of the ultimate conclusion of the practical syllogism: but may
be modified so as to apply to the other senses of the word.

The Author's Definition or Description of Conscience contains, as
we have said, twelve distinct elements, which he now proceeds to exa-
mine and establish in order. For the convenience of reference we
may distinguish these elements by the first twelve letters of the alpha-
bet, respectively.

According to Sanderson, then, Conscience is
'⁷ (A) A Faculty, or (B) Habit of the (Ε) practical (D) Intellect, by
which the mind of (C) man doth, (M) by Discourse of Reason, (K) apply
(L) the Light which 1s in it, to (H) its own (G) particular (I) moral
(F) acts.

These twelve elements are established and discussed in the follow-
ing sections. A, in Sect. xvn3 B, in Sect. xv1113 C, in Sect. xx3 D
and Ε, in Sect. xxm F, (ἶ, Η, Ι, in Sect. xxn3 K, in Sect. xxw3 L,
in Sect. xxv3 M, in Sect. XXV13 also G‘ is further discussed in Sect. xxvn.

In the Desinit-ion, we have to consider four things, the Genus, the
Subject, the Object, and the Act. Thus if we say, Intuition is a Habit
of the Mind by which it perceives the truth of First Principles ,· Habit
is the yemis, the Minol is the subject; First Principles are the object,-
perceives the truth of them, is the Act. Definitions according to this
formula occur in Aristotle.

14. The general mode of defining is by Genus and Differentia; as
when we define man, “ a Rational Animal ;” Animal is the Genus, and
