UOUSQUE, postquam ventis vela dedissem subtristi
licet coeli facie, incolumis tamen (Deo auspice) in insti-
tuto cursu processeram, jamque altum mare tenebam3 certUS,
si per tempora liceret, qua ire occoeperam pergendi: cum
coorta ante oculos saeva tempestaS, et jam propius adventare
visa, admonuit, parum tutam fore in posterum omnem in
alto navigationem. Sensi itaque nova protinus mihi capienda
esse consilia, nec nisi mallem ventis debere ludibrium, in
undoso et periculoso mari moram trahendam longius, Vela
ergo confestim retrorsum dedi, et navim mature subduxi in
portum. Namque et mihi paulo honestius visum est, gradu
cedere, quam depelli: et rebus meis longe salutariuS, pri-
vatos intra lares in otio et in umbra vivere, quam in Foro vel
Theatro cum invidia et metu versari.

must have been added at a later period]

now far advanced in my subject, and secure, if the times had allowed
it, of reaching my destined point 3 the fierce tempest which arose and
drew nearer and nearer, warned me, that for the future, sailing in the
open ocean [public lecturing, as Ι suppose] was by no means safe3 Ι ..
perceived that I must change my course, and not linger in that rough
and. dangerous sea, except I were willing to be wrecked. I sailed back
again, and. sought shelter in port. It appeared to me more decent to
withdraw than to be thrust out: and better, for my private condition,
to live at leisure in retirement, than to take a place in the Forum or
the Public Assembly, the regions of hatred and sear.
