PRAELEOTIO SECUNDA. 43

quoad totam suam speciem, Bonus vel Malus. Sic dicimus
esse Furtum et Adulterium de tota sua specie Mala ; Elee-
mosyuam et Precationem de specie sua Bona. Hoc tamen
observato discrimine, quod quae mala sunt simpliciter, mala
sunt, nec possunt ratione cujuscunque finis quantumlibet
boni, aut quarumcunque vel commodissimarum περιστάσεων,
fieri bona .· at quae natura sua bona sunt, possunt tamen a
fine aut indebitis circumstantiis ita vitiari, ut desinant esse
bona, et fiant mala. Supposita ergo pravitate Objecti, abs-
tinendum est protinus ab actu, ut simpliciter malo, veluti a
Furto, ab Adulterio, etc„ nec opus est ulteriori examine. At
supposita bonitate Objecti, non statim cuiquam tutum est ad
agendum se comparare, aut quod actum fuerit comprobare3
nisi expensis prius diligenter et Fine ad quem dirigitur, et
singulis quibus quasi vestitur CircumstantiiS. Illa ergo quae
dici solent, Bonitatem actuum pendere a fine, et Finem dis-
criminare actioneS, eatenus quidem vera sunt, si actus ratione
Objecti sive Materiae sint boni, vel saltem medii et indiffe-
rentes3 non autem si mali. Objecti enim bonitate supposita,
Actus bonitatem suam et malitiam praecipue sumit a Fine.

and as to its kind, called good or bad. Thus Theft and Adultery, are,
by their kind, bad: Alms and Prayer are, by their kind, good. But
there is this difference z—Acts which are bad are simply bad, and can-
not become good by reason of any end, however good, or any cir-
cumstances, however suitable: but Acts which are good may, by
reason of the end, or of undue circumstances, cease to be good and
become evil. And thus if the ObJect (or kind of the act) be supposed
bad, the act must be absolutely avoided without further inqusty, as
Theft or Adultery. But if the act be good, as to its kind, we cannot
yet approve of it, till we have considered the end and the circumstances.
And thus what is often said, that ‘⁶ the goodness of an act depends
on the End,'’ and that “ the End makes the difference of actions‚'’ is
true so far, if the acts are good as to their kind, or at least if they
are indifferent, but not if they are bad. Supposing the goodness of the
action as to its kind, it does take its goodness or badness mainly
from the End. Thus Alms to the poor, an Act good as to its kind, if
it be done for vain glory, becomes evil, because it is not done in order
to a good End. The same act, if done to relieve the need of our
neighbour, is so far good, that it is good as to the matter, and done
with a right intention3 and thus has goodness of the Object or Matter,
and goodness of the End ; but yet it cannot forthwith be called simply
- good, unless it be duly circumstanced: [for instance, that in giving
