EDITOR'S PREFACE. v

but in the earlier portions this distinction has been,
through oversight, neglected.

The references of the quotations to their proper
sources have been verified and completed by the Rev.
H. A. HOLDEN, M.A. Fellow of Trinity Collegeâ€š by
whom also the Indexes have been compiled. These
useful and laborious tasks cannot fail to be considered
as adding materially to the value of the work.

This work may be considered as an excellent
and striking example of a certain period of our
ethical literature, and in that point of view, pos-
sesses great interest for the student of Moral Phi-
losophy. But it is also a work, even still, of no
small moral value3 for it would be difficult to dis-
cuss most of the moral questions which form the
latter part of the work, in a more satisfactory man-
ner than is here done. In saying this, we of course
except the cases in which Sanderson maintains that
doctrine, of the divine right of kingS, which was
then common in England, and which is now obso-
lete3 but which does not vitiate other parts of his
reasoning. The passages thus to be excepted are,
for the most part, adverted to in the NoteS.
