16 DE DEFIN ITION E CONSOIENTIAE.

patet sumi quandoque Effective, pro aliquo actu suc, sicut
et Scientioe vox pro actuali consideratione, improprie tamen.
Sed proprie loquendo Applicatio Scientiae non est ipsa Con-
scientia, sed ejus actus, sicut Consideratio non est ipsa
Scientia, sed ejus actus. Non est ergo Conscientia Actus.
XV. Relinquitur ergo quod aut Potentia sit, aut Habi-
tus: nam quod non sit Forma, (nempe Anima ipsa, sed
aliquid ejus,) apud omnes in confesso est. N eotericorum non
paucis Potentiam esse contendunt, negant esse Habitum.
Quod sit Potentia, probant: Primo, quia est quaedam quasi 1
Memoria ,· quum ad Conscientiam respiciat intellectus cogi-
tans de Ayibitibus, sicut respicit ad Memoriam, cogitans (19
Speculabilibus; Et Memoria est Potentia non Habitus.
Secundo, quia Potentia est illud per quod agens est primo 2
potens ad agendum: per Conscientiam autem homo est potens
dictare quid sibi sit faciendum, et approbare vel improbare
quod est a se factum3 idque prima quia posita conscientia

be different powers. ⁴ Of these Questfflns, the twelfth is, Whether the
Synteresis be a special and distinct power3 and the thirteenth‚ Whether
the Conscience be 9 power of the mind. On this latter Question,
the conclusion 19, 11191 ‘⁶ 0099919999, properly taken, is not a power,
but an act by which we apply our knowledge to the deeds which we
do; this application being followed by condemnation or apprehen-
sion.” Against this opinion, though held by some of the Reformers‚
our Author argues thus.

0099919999 includes many acts: it dictates, impeIs, accuses, excuses,
&c. If Conscience were an Act, these would be Acts of an Act.
Therefore it is not an Act3 it is either the Mind itself, or a Power, or a
Habit of the Mind.

15. The Mind, or rather the 80111, 19, according to Aristotle and
the Schoolmen, the Form of the Body. 899 Arist. de Anima, 11. 1.
Ἀναγκαῖον ἄρα τὴν ψυχὴν οὐσίαν εἶναι ὥς εἶδος σώματος φυσικοῦ δυνάμει
ζωὴν ἔχοντος. Τ1119 phraseology is accepted by Sanderson. And 119
urges that Conscience is not the 80111 119911, but something belonging
to the 80111 ; 1119 question is, whether a Power, or a Habit.

Τ119 arguments to prove 0099919999 9 Power of the 80111 are these:

First: it is a sort of Memory, and Memory is a Power. As the
Intellect, cogitating of things to be done, looks to Conscience3 90, cogi-
tating of things to be known, it looks 10 Memory.

Secondly3 that is 9 Power by which, as 9 fundamental reason, the
agent is able to act, (primo potens ad agendum 3) now 0099919999 19 11191
by which man is able to dictate to himself what to do, and to approve
or disapprox're what he does 3 and (primo) as a fundamental reason, for
having a conscience, he can do this ; if conscience be removed, he cannot.
