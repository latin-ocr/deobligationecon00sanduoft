it is purely a book of reference, and as such it

volume it may be said that it is a genuine
service rendered to the study of University
history, and that the habits of ythought of any
writer educated at either seat of learning in
the last century will, in many cases, be far
better understood after a consideration of the
materials here collected.”—-A cademy.
