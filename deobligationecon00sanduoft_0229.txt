PRAELEGTIO SEPTIMA. 205

<hanc Forma .· ultimum agmen ducit et claudit Finis. De
Legum causa Efficiente, quum in Quintce Praelectionis Con-
clusione tertia satis ostensum fuerit, Leges humanas nisi a
persona leyitimam potestatem habente latas non obligare:
illud nunc imprimis dispiciendum restat, penes quos sit ἐξουσία
νομοθετική, hoc est, justa et legitima Leyes ferendi potestas ‚·
sive quinam sint Leyum conditores illi, quibus ex mente Salo-
monis justa decernendi jus competit. Huic Domo PRIMO et
in hoc causae genere longe praecipuo, ut plene respondeatur,
duo interim supponenda sunt. Suppono itaque primo, potes-
tatem Lequmlativam esse potestatem alicujus Superioris, sicut
proecipere, (praeceptionis appellatione prohibitionem etiam
complector,) qui est hactus Leyis proprius, est actus superi-
oris. Distare non parum hac ex parte animadvertere est tria
1 haec: Promis-sionem, Petitionem, Praeceptionem. Commune ·
est omnium indiscriminatim, Superiorum, [ufer-iorum, AEqua-
lium, promittere. Potest enim promittere aliquid, et Pater
filio, et Filius patri, et Frater Vicinusve fratri aut vicino,

tenus3 ut petit sibi dari veniam, vel gratiam fieri, a patre

2. The next point to be considered is, Laws as affected by their
Efficient Cause ‚· after that, we shall have to consider the Form, and
aster that, the End of the Law.

In Prceleot. V„ Conclusion 111., we have shewn that Laws do not
oblige, except when made by a person having legitimate power. We
have now to consider:

v DOUBT Fmsr. Who have a legitimate power to make Laws.

To answer this, we suppose that,

First .· The Legislative Power is the power of a Superior.

There are three different kinds of communication among men to
be considered3 Promise, Petition, Oommand:

’ Promise is common to superiors, inferiors, and equals, A father
promises to his son, a son to his father, a brother or neighbour to his
brother or neighbour.

Petitiort is the act of Inferiors properly, partly of Equals3 but not
of Superiors except improperly. A son asks a favour of his father, a
neighbour of his neighbour3 and a father may ask pardon or a favour
of his son.

Command is especially the act of Superiors. For an Inferior to
command his Superior, or an Equal his Equal, would be absurd.
Every Act requires a proportionate Power3 and an equal has no Power
over an equal.
