264 DE LEGE POENALI.

poenam ipso facto subeundam, ante latam a judice sententiam3
sive, quod idem est, priusquam a persona legitimam auctori-
tatem habente ea poena ab ipso exigatur. Tenetur quidem
reus poenas dare ; sed si reposcantur: alias non tenetur.
Dico tertio, reum, post latam a judice sententiam, aut a per· 3
sona legitimam auctoritatem habente requisitum, ad poenam
sponte suscipiendam teneri, etiam cum aliqua sua cooperatione,-
si ejusmodi cooperatio non sit contra humanitatem, etsi alias
fortasse admodum gravis et onerosa. Exempli gratia, si ju-
beatur poenae nomine grandem pecuniae summam dependere,
reyno exire, etc. tenetur reus vi legis id facere. Quod si
poena imposita non 9rave sit tantum, sed aliquid etiam in se
contineat quod sit inhumanum, ut si quis jubeatur se flayel-
lare, dextram sibi praecidere, cicutam bibere etc„ dico quarto 4
in ejusmodi casibus teneri quidem reum, ad pomam eam, quam

Thirdly: When the Judge has pronounced sentence, or when the
penalty is duly demanded by an authorized person, the condemned
person is bound to submit frankly to the punishment3 provided his
co-operation be not against humanity: as if the punishment be, to pay

Fourthly .- If the punishment be not only heavy, but contain some-
thing inhuman, as if the person be required to scourge himself, to cut
off his right hand, to drink poison 3 he is bound passively to submit to
the punishment, but not actively to cooperate.

[I have translated this Lecture less fully than most of the preceding
parts3 inasmuch as it appears to me, to be less valuable than the
greater part of the Author's discussions. The question, How far
Human Laws are binding upon the Oonscience? is a very important
one3 but the solution here given of several of its branches is not very
satisfactory. Perhaps Sanderson has too much attempted to make the
answer depend upon the Form of the Laws, whereas it must also be
greatly regulated by the Matter. A good citizen will, in ordinary
cases, accept the Law of the Land as a rule for the guidance of his
intentioris, as well as his actions, in virtue of the general sympathy
which he gives to the public legitimate actions of the State of which he
is a member. But if the Law command something which is immoral,
or contrary to the Law of God, he can no longer accept it as a Rule
for his intentions, nor even for his actions, as Sanderson himself has
taught, Proelect. v. And if, in such cases, it imposes penalties, he may
be obliged to submit to the penalties, but he reJects the Law in his
Conscience. Again: Human Laws are not universally binding on the
Conscience, even when consonant to morality and religion, but only in
