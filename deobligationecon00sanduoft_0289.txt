PRAELEOTIO OCTAVA. 265

scivit lege constitutam, quamque culpa sua commeruit, passive
subeundam .- non item obligari ad active cooperandum in
eadem. Et haec de Leyum promulyandarum necessitate, et
de Le9um Poenalium obliqatione, quae ad legum causam
formalem aliquo modo pertinere videntur, dicta sunto,

those cases, which are properly regulated by Human Laws. The
intention of the Legislator, even when moral and religious, does not
bind the Conscience of the citizen in those matters about which there
should be no legislation. Again: perhaps even when the Law is
both moral and within the proper sphere of human legislation, too
much stress is laid by Sanderson upon the intention of the original
Legislator. The State, which' accepts and enforces the Law, not the
original maker of the Law, is really the authority which gives the
meaning of the Law3 and may, by subsequent practice, modify the
original intention of the Lawgiver. Sanderson is especially bound to
admit this, holding, (in opposition to the maxims of English Law,) that
desuetude may abrogate a Law, (Praelect. vn. Sect. 22.) For if custom
may entirely abolish the Law, it may, a fortiori, modify it.

Sanderson, in the greater part of these lectures, has handled the
Aristotelian formulae and classifications with great skill and to good
purpose3 but in the present lecture he seems to me to be less success-
ful than usual in the use of these instruments.]
